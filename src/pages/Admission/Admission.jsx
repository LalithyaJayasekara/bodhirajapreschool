            Lower Kindergarten (LKG) at our preschool is designed to engage and educate children at this formative age, nurturing their natural curiosity. Our experienced teachers create a stimulating environment where children can explore, discover, and care for their world. Through a range of hands-on activities, children develop essential skills in literacy, numeracy, and social interaction, all while having fun. LKG is a unique foundation that prepares your child for the exciting educational journey ahead.
